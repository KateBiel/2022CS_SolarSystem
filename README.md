# üöÄ Solar System (My First Unity Game) üöÄ

SolarSystem  is a dynamic, educational project that I completed as part of the Introduction to Unity unit at Circuit Stream XR. Designed as a space exploration game, the project showcases a range of key Unity development features and coding techniques. I was a newbie here so nothing special. 

‚ú® Timeline: 1 week

üî¥ YouTube Demo: [Solar System Gameplay](https://youtu.be/GtmAc1zIBew)

    - Current version
    - Unity 2021.3.13
    - 3D URP
    - PC Only 



üìö The main objective of Solar System is to voyage through space, gain knowledge about our cosmic environs, interact with celestial bodies, combat threatening asteroids, and unearth hidden Easter eggs to enhance your gameplay journey.

 1. Flight Controls:
    - 'W' Key: Move your spaceship forward.
    - 'S' Key: Move your spaceship backward.
    - 'A' Key: Strafe left.
    - 'D' Key: Strafe right.
    
    Use these keys to navigate your spaceship through space, and approach different celestial bodies like planets or other spacecrafts.

2. Combat and Interactions:
    - Left Mouse Click: Shoot your laser to destroy the asteroids.
    - Left Mouse Click: Shoot at celestial planes to uncover their names. For an automatic audio description, simply fly close to the planet.

3. Lerping Animation:
    - 'Space' Key: Activate the lerping animation. This will initiate a sequence where two other spaceships, attached to Mars and Earth, perform a lerp.


# Easter Egg

There's an Easter egg located on Mars. To find it, explore the Martian surface closely.

 <summary><h3>üíª More Info About Project</h3></summary>
At the core of the game is a model of the solar system. Some of its parts were brought by using assets from Unity's Asset Store. However, these assets required customization to fit the project's needs. For instance, I had to adjust models to render double-sided materials in Unity and add extra faces where needed. Some models, unsuitable in their original form, were extensively modified using Blender to meet the game's specifications. These modifications showcase my gained adaptability and skills in navigating and customizing resources in Unity's ecosystem.

The gameplay mechanics incorporate a ship controller programmed directly in the Unity environment. The ship controller was created to offer interactive, real-time navigation across the solar system, demonstrating the use of scripts to control player movement and inputs.

Moreover, the game features a coded shooting system, a key interactive element adding to the player engagement. This system was implemented to showcase how combat or action mechanics can be created using Unity's scripting and physics systems.

An essential part of the game is the script-controlled rotation of the planets. This feature was implemented to display the use of scripts in controlling object transformations and movements within the 3D game space, simulating the orbital movement found in our solar system.

In conclusion, the project incorporates a distinctive audio activation system rooted in game triggers. Rather than simply sourcing information about the planets from online resources, I chose a more traditional approach. I utilized a collection of vintage National Geographic magazines from a friend's house, imbuing the project with a sense of authenticity and personal touch.

Upon finalizing the script based on these well-researched facts, I employed an AI text-to-speech tool to generate audio content. This audio is activated upon shooting in the game, which further showcases the versatility of Unity's scripting capabilities. Such an implementation enriches the gaming atmosphere, rendering it more responsive and immersive.

Given more time, I would have loved to implement a scoring system and refine the audio performance for an even more immersive experience. I also envisioned enhancing the visual appeal to make the game more aesthetically pleasing. However, due to the constraints of time, I had to prioritize and focus on applying the skills I've acquired thus far.

Overall, I take immense satisfaction in the completion of this project. The journey was not only educational but also enjoyable, providing me with an opportunity to explore and understand Unity. The enjoyment I derived from working on the project truly encapsulates the adage, "The joy is in the journey."

üê±‚ÄçüöÄ Thank you for your time! I wish you a day filled with happiness and exciting cosmic adventures ‚ú®
