# ðŸš€ Solar System ðŸš€

SolarSystem  is a dynamic, educational project that I completed as part of the Introduction to Unity unit at Circuit Stream XR. Designed as a space exploration game, the project showcases a range of key Unity development features and coding techniques. I was a newbie here so nothing special.

The main objective of Solar System  is to explore the vastness of space, interact with different celestial bodies, and battle the menacing asteroids. Discover hidden Easter eggs within the game to enhance your gameplay experience.


# Controles and Actions

    - 'W' Key: Move your spaceship forward.
    - 'S' Key: Move your spaceship backward.

    Use these keys to navigate your spaceship through space, and approach different celestial bodies like planets or other spacecrafts.

2. Interactions:
    - When you approach planes (spaceships or planets), an automatic audio description will start to give you information about what you're encountering.

3. Combat:
    - Left Mouse Click: Shoot your laser to destroy the asteroids.

4. Lerping Animation:
    - 'Space' Key: Activate the lerping animation. This will initiate a sequence where two other spaceships, attached to Mars and Earth, perform a lerp.
